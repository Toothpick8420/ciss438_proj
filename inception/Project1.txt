Project Part I (Inception Phase) 
Due date: March 13, 2023 
- Name/Identify functionalities and Use Cases (functional requirements) of your system 
Functionalities:
* Choose Difficulty
* Choose Player Character
* Choose Level
* Clock chooses a character
* Play Match
* Save Profile
* Save High Scores


Use Cases:
* Use Case UC1: Play Street Fighter[a]
        - Level: User Goal
        - Actors: Player
        - Stakeholders and Interests: Player- wants to play a game of Street Fighter
        - Description: This use case begins when the player selects play game from the main scene.
        They will then select their character and the level they will be playing, while the computer 
        will select it’s character. The match will then initialize and the player will then play the 
        match.
* Use Case UC2: Register Profile
        - Level: User Goal
        - Stakeholders and Interests: Player- wants to register a player profile to save their stats 
        for their previous games of Street Fighter.
        - Description: This use case begins when a player selects the register profile option from 
        the main screen. They will be prompted to create a username and password for their profile.
        They will then be prompted for a username and password.
* Use Case UC3: Select Profile
        - Level: User Goal
        - Stakeholders and Interests: Player- wants to access their profile to see their statistics.
        - Description: The use case begins when a player selects the select profile option from the

Non-Functional Requirements:
* Music in the style of the old Street Fighter Games
* Player Art
*  Implemented using C++ and SDL
* Licensed using Creative Commons Non-Commercial licensing
 
- Identify use cases with high risk because they are the first to be implemented
High Risk Use Cases with Analysis:
* Use Case UC1: Play Street Fighter
        - Level: User Goal
        - Actors: Player, Clock
        - Stakeholders and Interests: Player- wants to play a game of Street Fighter
        - Description: This use case begins when the player selects play game from 
        the main scene. They will then select their character and the level they will
        be playing, while the computer will select it’s character. The match will then 
        initialize and the player will then play the match.

        Main Success Scenario:
            1. Player selects play before being prompted to initialize the game, selecting difficulty, their character, and the level.
            2. Clock selects a character.
            3. Player and Clock characters move around the level until one wins.
            4. Clock saves the match data to the profile.
                    Alternatives:
                    4a: If no profile is selected for the player, no match data is saved.


* Use Case UC2: Register Profile
        - Level: User Goal
        - Actors: Player
        - Stakeholders and Interests: Player- wants to register a player profile to save their stats for their previous games of Street Fighter.
        - Description: This use case begins when a player selects the register profile option from the main screen. They will be prompted to create a username and password for their profile. They will then be prompted for a username and password.
        Main Success Scenario:
            1. Player selects Create Profile option.
            2. Player enters their username and password.
                    Alternatives:
                    2a: If the entered username is already present in the Database, prompt the player again and Player repeats step 2.


 
Use Cases implemented in the first iteration of the elaboration phase:
    *  Play Street Fighter (Very Rough Version, without graphics. Simply using rectangles, not DB support)

[a]Just defined use cases generally in this segment, as there is another part that requires us to define the use cases in depth.
