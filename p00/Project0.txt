    Our final project for this semester will be a clone of an arcade game named 
Street Fighter. Therefore, the name of the system in which our users will use 
will be StreetFighter. The users for this project will be players who would like 
to play Street Fighter. The primary way that our users will be using our system 
is to play this game as if they were playing it in an arcade. This will be 
accomplished by allowing users to enter inputs to move their character around and 
attack their opponent. The system will have a variety of functions to help users 
have fun and stay engaged within our game. One of these is updating the game 
state, moving the player, and also making moves for the opponent's character. 
Furthermore, another functional requirement of this game is a health and damage 
system. This is helpful to helping the player achieve goals as these functions 
are essential to a fun game experience similar to the original game, as it will 
be a visual indicator for how well they are doing as well as how close they are 
to achieving a victory state within the system. One of the final functional 
requirements are graphics and sound effects. This will help the player interact 
with and be immersed in the game, as a means of interacting with the system itself.
